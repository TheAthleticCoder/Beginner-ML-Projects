# Beginner-ML-Projects

## Hi, this repository stores a couple of interesting beginner project codes in the field of AI and Machine Learning. 
### The projects are pretty basic, but vast since they involve-
1. OpenCV for real time image processing.
2. Regression Modules and techniques.
3. Image processing using Neural Networks (CNNs).
